    "## 1. Problem Definition & Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Selected Project Track<br>\n",
    "Track:\n",
    "AI-powered Recommendation System (Human-in-the-loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem Statement:<br>\n",
    "Traditional movie recommendation systems primarily rely on:\n",
    "- User-item interaction history (collaborative filtering), or\n",
    "- Content similarity (genre, keywords, embeddings)\n",
    "\n",
    "While effective at scale, these systems often fail to account for human cognitive context, such as:\n",
    "- The user’s current mental state or intent\n",
    "- Cognitive load tolerance\n",
    "- Desire for comfort vs novelty\n",
    "- Identity-based preferences (casual vs exploratory viewers)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, recommendations may be technically relevant but psychologically misaligned, leading to:\n",
    "- Choice overload\n",
    "- Emotional mismatch\n",
    "- Reduced user satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Objective:<br>\n",
    "The objective of this project is to design and implement a human-centric movie recommendation system that goes beyond semantic similarity by integrating:\n",
    "- User purpose and intent\n",
    "- Cognitive tolerance\n",
    "- Identity-based biases\n",
    "- Novelty vs familiarity preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "The system introduces a HumanSense Innovation Layer, which acts as an adaptive scoring mechanism on top of traditional semantic similarity, producing recommendations that are context-aware, emotionally aligned, and cognitively comfortable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Real-World Relevance & Motivation:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world scenarios such as:\n",
    "- Watching content after a stressful day\n",
    "- Casual weekend viewing\n",
    "- Seeking emotional comfort or light entertainment\n",
    "- Users often do not want:\n",
    "- The most popular movie\n",
    "- The highest-rated movie\n",
    "- The most semantically similar movie\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, they want content that “feels right” for the moment.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to simulate that human decision-making process using:\n",
    "- NLP-based embeddings\n",
    "- Behavioral heuristics\n",
    "- Hybrid AI scoring logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Such systems have practical relevance in:\n",
    "- Streaming platforms\n",
    "- Mental well-being–aware recommendation systems\n",
    "- Personalized media consumption tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Key Innovation:<br>\n",
    "Unlike conventional recommendation pipelines, this system introduces:<br>\n",
    "\"A HumanSense Fusion Engine - <br>\n",
    "that dynamically adjusts recommendation scores using human-centric factors rather than relying solely on similarity metrics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This innovation layer makes the system:\n",
    "- More explainable\n",
    "- More adaptive\n",
    "- More aligned with real human behavior"

    "## 2. Data Understanding & Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Dataset Source\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses a publicly available movie metadata dataset derived from **The Movie Database (TMDB)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains detailed information about movies, including:\n",
    "- Movie title and overview\n",

    "- Runtime (duration)\n",
    "- Popularity score\n",
    "- Average user ratings\n",

    "\n",
    "**Project Track:**  \n",
    "Recommendation Systems / Hybrid AI System\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques Used:**\n",
    "- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for semantic understanding\n",
    "- Embedding-based similarity using Sentence Transformers\n",
    "- Rule-guided human-centric scoring\n",
    "- Hybrid recommendation architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This system is **not a pure collaborative filtering model** nor a **pure content-based recommender**.  \n",
    "Instead, it is a **human-aware hybrid recommendation system** that integrates semantic understanding with psychological and cognitive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Overall System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "HumanSense is designed as a **multi-layer decision system** that mimics how humans choose movies, rather than simply optimizing for similarity or popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-level pipeline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Movie Understanding Layer**\n",
    "   - Movie overviews and genres are converted into semantic embeddings.\n",
    "   - Captures meaning, tone, and narrative depth beyond keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Intent Layer**\n",
    "   - User explicitly specifies:\n",
    "     - Purpose of watching (Relax, Uplift, Distract, Explore)\n",
    "     - Self-identity (Casual / Artistic)\n",
    "     - Cognitive tolerance\n",
    "     - Novelty preference\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **HumanSense Fusion Engine**\n",
    "   - Combines multiple signals:\n",
    "     - Semantic similarity\n",
    "     - Purpose alignment\n",
    "     - Identity bias\n",
    "     - Cognitive load penalty\n",
    "     - Novelty modulation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Ranking Layer**\n",
    "   - Movies are scored using a human-aligned scoring function.\n",
    "   - Top recommendations are selected based on final scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Key Components Description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Embedding Generator\n",
    "- Uses a pre-trained Sentence-BERT (MiniLM) model.\n",
    "- Encodes movie overviews and genres into dense vectors.\n",
    "- Enables semantic matching (e.g., “comforting” ≈ “warm”, “light-hearted”).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Purpose Modeling\n",
    "- Each viewing purpose is mapped to a psychological preference vector.\n",
    "- Controls expected:\n",
    "  - Emotional intensity\n",
    "  - Narrative pace\n",
    "  - Cognitive demand\n",
    "- Ensures recommendations align with *why* the user is watching.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Self-Identity Modeling\n",
    "- Models how users perceive themselves:\n",
    "  - Artistic users are biased toward low-familiarity or indie content.\n",
    "  - Casual users are biased toward mainstream content.\n",
    "- Introduces identity-aware personalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Cognitive Load Control\n",
    "- Prevents emotional or narrative overload.\n",
    "- Penalizes movies that exceed the user's cognitive tolerance.\n",
    "- Improves comfort and reduces decision fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Novelty Modulation (Innovation Layer)\n",
    "- Controls exploration vs familiarity.\n",
    "- Allows safe recommendations at low novelty.\n",
    "- Encourages discovery and serendipity at high novelty.\n",
    "- Makes the system adaptive and non-static.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Fusion Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional recommendation systems typically optimize for:\n",
    "- Click-through rate\n",
    "- Watch time\n",
    "- Popularity or similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "HumanSense instead optimizes for:\n",
    "- Emotional alignment\n",
    "- Cognitive comfort\n",
    "- Self-identity consistency\n",
    "- Intent fulfillment\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in fewer but **more meaningful and trustworthy recommendations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Design Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "| Design Choice | Justification |\n",
    "|--------------|--------------|\n",
    "Embedding-based similarity | Captures semantic meaning better than keyword matching |\n",
    "Purpose vectors | Align recommendations with user intent |\n",
    "Rule-guided fusion | Improves interpretability and control |\n",
    "Cognitive penalty | Prevents emotional overload |\n",
    "Novelty preference | Balances comfort and exploration |\n",
    "\n",

    "### 5.2 Evaluation Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each recommendation generated by HumanSense is evaluated across the following dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Relevance**  \n",
    "   Measures how closely the movie content matches the user’s purpose description using sentence embeddings and cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Purpose Alignment**  \n",
    "   Ensures the recommendation aligns with the user’s declared intent (e.g., RELAX, FOCUS, ESCAPE).\n",

    "3. **Identity Fit**  \n",
    "   Adjusts scoring based on the user’s identity (casual viewer vs. cinephile).\n",
